Unet is a deep learning based image segmentation approach.It gained popularity in the year 2015 when a research group from oxford published their winning model in the ISBI cell tracking challenge. Following is the link for the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04597
Recently, the problem of automatic nuclei segmentation in medical images has seen success using deep learning techniques. Here, I attempt to build a unet model for the Data Science Bowl 2018 dataset.
